# Project-01-AstroWhisper
This is Ritu's, Anna's, and William's first project on an Astrology gnenerator

## Challenge 

The challenge is to develop a web application that offers horoscope for users based on their date of birth. Users can also find out their fortune for the day. We created the application from scratch starting with the the basic conecptualization of what we wanted, to making a basic wireframe in Figma, to coding the apple 

## Solution

The final app integrates astrology insights based on user's zodiac sign (particularly, user's moon sign).

## User Story

```
AS An avid Astrology enthusiast
I WANT AN astrology generator
SO THAT I can obtain more information about Zodiac signs and recieve a fortune 
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an astrology generator
WHEN I click the "generate horoscope" button

```

     (ii) "fortune" button and a brief fortune forecast for the day (window pops up by clicking the "fortune" button).
